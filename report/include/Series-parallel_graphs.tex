\subsection{Drawing Algorithm For Maximal Series Parallel Graphs With Two Bends}

The tree decomposition $(T,W)$ of a $2$-tree $G$ will be evaluated for its largest maximal outerplanar graph with tree decomposition $(T',W')$. $\tilde{T}$ is defined as the difference of $T$ and $T'$ and is a set of subtrees of $T$.\\
After $(T',W')$ is drawn into a box drawing $B'$, the remaining subtrees in $\tilde{T}$ will be inserted accordingly, resulting in a box drawing $B$ for $G$. Finally, a polyline drawing will be derived from $B$.
