\section{A New Approach}
\subsection{Introduction}
The research of the implementation of planar graph drawings over the last decades achieved various results - For instance, the orthogonal Kandinsky model suits as a foundation of postprocessing algorithms for newer models such as the SMOG. A new approach for graphs with maximal one crossing per edge is claimed. This new model serves as an extension of planar drawings, such as SMOGs or Kandinsky drawings.

%\subsection{First steps of a new model - \grqq Smooth Octilinear Drawings\grqq}
%Goal is to design a new model which derives from the orthogonal Kandinsky drawing. Furthermore we want to establish the possibility of inclusion of the Kandinsky model, SMOGs and octilinear drawings. This means that the vertices are still boxes of uniform size, there are as many connections per port possible as the maximum degree of the graph values and the possibility of diagonal connections (the octilinear model) shall be implemented.
%\begin{definition}[Smooth Octilinear Drawings]
%	A drawing according to the new model $\Gamma(G)$ of a graph $G$ with arbitrary maximum degree is a drawing on a grid embedding. This model inherits
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item a coarse grid for the vertices which is a subset of a fine grid for the edges. The granularity of the fine grid is determined by the maximal degree of $G$;
%		\item every vertex is illustrated as a box with uniform size centralized on the coarse grid;
%		\item every edge is drawn as a sequence of horizontal, vertical and diagonal line segments and / or multiples of octi arcs.
%		\item there are as many edges per vertex side possible as the maximum degree of $G$ specifies;
%		\item it is possible to connect a polyedge to a corner of the vertex box for diagonal connections.
%		\item possible crossings of edges shall be illustrated with a 90\degree~angle
%	\end{itemize}
%\end{definition}
%This new model with its properties serves as a superset model for various others. If 90\degree~or 270\degree~bends would be allowed, meaning that consecutive segments can be horizontal or vertical, then this new model includes planar Kandinsky drawings. Furthermore, it could include all Smooth Orthogonal and Octilinear drawings.
